          These Terms &amp; Conditions (&ldquo;Terms&rdquo;) govern your access to and use of SEO4AI
          (the &ldquo;Service&rdquo;), operated by SEO4AI (&ldquo;we&rdquo;, &ldquo;us&rdquo;,

        <h2>1. The Service</h2>
        <p>
          SEO4AI helps you measure and improve how AI assistants (such as ChatGPT, Gemini, and
          Perplexity) reference your brand, and provides related content and recommendations. The
          Service relies on third-party AI models whose outputs are probabilistic and change over
          time. We do not control these models.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Accounts</h2>
        <p>
          You are responsible for the information you provide, for activity under your account, and
          for keeping your credentials secure. You must provide a valid email address and use the
          Service only for lawful purposes.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Acceptable use</h2>

          You agree not to misuse the Service, including: attempting to disrupt or reverse-engineer
          it, scraping or reselling it without permission, submitting unlawful content, or using it
          to infringe others&apos; rights. We may suspend or terminate accounts that violate these
          Terms.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Plans, billing &amp; payments</h2>
        <p>
          Paid plans are billed in advance on a recurring basis through our payment processor. By
          subscribing, you authorize recurring charges until you cancel. You can cancel at any time;
          your plan remains active until the end of the current billing period. Prices and plan
          features may change with notice.
        </p>

        <h2>5. No refunds</h2>
        <p>
          All payments are <strong>final and non-refundable</strong>. We do not provide refunds or
          credits for any partial subscription period, unused features, or after a plan change or
          cancellation, except where a refund is strictly required by applicable law. Please see our{' '}
          <a href="/refund" className="text-violet-700 underline">Refund Policy</a> for details. A
          free plan is available so you can evaluate the Service before purchasing.
        </p>

        <h2>6. No guarantee of results</h2>
        <p>
          AI visibility depends on many factors outside our control. We do not guarantee any
          specific ranking, mention, score, traffic, or business outcome. Recommendations and
          generated content are provided &ldquo;as is&rdquo; for your judgment and use.
        </p>

        <h2>7. Intellectual property</h2>

          The Service, including its software, design, and content, is owned by SEO4AI and protected
          by law. Content you generate using the Service is yours to use; you are responsible for how
          you publish and use it.
        </p>

        <h2>8. Disclaimers &amp; limitation of liability</h2>
        <p>
          The Service is provided &ldquo;as is&rdquo; and &ldquo;as available&rdquo; without
          warranties of any kind. To the maximum extent permitted by law, SEO4AI is not liable for
